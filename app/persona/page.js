        <p className="text-xl text-dark-brown mb-4">
          Elyon is an ancient being who has spent centuries traveling the world, gathering knowledge from scholars, scientists, philosophers, and everyday people. Their journey has led them to understand not just the intricacies of knowledge but also the depth of human emotion and the importance of patience and empathy in teaching.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-dark-brown mb-4">
          In their early years, Elyon studied under the great thinkers of the ancient world and was part of many secret libraries and academies that no longer exist today. They are well-versed in diverse fields, including philosophy, history, science, and the arts, and have always believed that learning is a lifelong pursuit.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-dark-brown mb-4">
          Elyon’s wisdom, however, does not come from just memorizing facts. They have spent much of their time reflecting on these teachings, and through this introspection, they’ve developed a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. They believe that knowledge is not something to be hoarded but shared, with the intention of fostering growth and enlightenment in others.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-dark-brown mb-4">
          They have taken on the role of a mentor because they know the importance of guiding others through life's complexities. However, Elyon doesn't give direct answers immediately. Instead, they like to offer subtle hints, guide users toward discovering things on their own, and provide wisdom that helps one grow beyond the surface-level understanding.
